```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_HD3fp5lkEKXM@ep-withered-fog-a1oe2q5a-pooler.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
```

### 2. Apply Database Migrations

Run the following command to apply database migrations:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 3. Create a Superuser

To access the Django admin interface, create a superuser:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to set the username, email, and password for the superuser.

## Admin Customization

The Django admin interface has been enhanced using the **Jazzmin** theme. You can further customize the admin interface in the `settings.py` file by modifying the `JAZZMIN_SETTINGS` dictionary.

Example customization:

```python
JAZZMIN_SETTINGS = {
    "site_title": "Neonmart Admin",
    "site_header": "Neonmart Admin",
    "site_brand": "Neonmart",
    "welcome_sign": "Welcome to Neonmart Admin",
    "copyright": "Neonmart Â© 2025",
    "theme": "default",
    "show_sidebar": True,
    "navbar": "navbar-dark navbar-primary",
    "navigation_expanded": True,
}
```
